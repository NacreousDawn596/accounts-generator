# accounts-generator
some little python codes to generate accounts on some known plateforms

# !!THIS WAS MADE FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY, I HOPE IT WON'T BE DOWN A SECOND TIME!!

# Goal:
just to show new python developers how to use selenium and requests by creating accounts and playing spotify music...

# how to set it up:

first install chromium browser:
```
sudo apt-get install chromium-browser -y
```

then:

```py
python3 setup.py
```
can I make it easier? lmao
